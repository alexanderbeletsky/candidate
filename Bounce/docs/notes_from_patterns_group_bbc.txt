BOUNCE
- referential transparency
- laziness

critique of nant/ant based build systems
- XML?
- global variables (we would never write code like that!)
- global variables prevent composition of build tasks!

Lets try Rake, Ruby's cool isn't it?
- finally, a proper programming language for builds!
- but wait, we're still using global variables! with exactly the same problems!
- still no composability!

feedback:
- print off the build order, with properties, effectively making a dry run (might be difficult...)
- some indication of what it did, success, which target it built, etc. nothing is a little disconcerting (done)
- team city output, hooks, or verbose output which we can parse and refashion for other purposes (done)
- copy the Targets.dll to another dll name, so we don't get conflicts when rebuilding Targets.dll (fixed)
- Iis6WebSite Directory is not full path (fixed)
